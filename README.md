## Project Goal

NextRole is **not** a job portal or ATS score checker. It's a **career intelligence and planning tool** that:

- Analyzes your current career profile from your resume
- Simulates 4-6 strategic future career paths
- Identifies skill gaps for each path
- Generates a **month-by-month actionable career roadmap**

The output feels like guidance from a **career consultant + strategist**, not a chatbot.
